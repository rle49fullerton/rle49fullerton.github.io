### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    I chose Lab 9, part 2 as a favorite because I got to write a program that
    wrote to a file and another to read from it. I enjoyed using these
    functionalities to implement a game of guessing a secret number.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 is a favorite because I got to work with data based on real
    life that was used in the code. I learned how to use 2D vectors to store
    different information that relates to each other.

* Lab 12

    Another one of my favorite labs is Lab 12, part 1 because I got to create an
    animation. I used an API to create a vector of images that give the effect
    of an animation when displayed quickly in sequence.
